The major features of <b>@x:Act</b> are listed here.
<ul>
<li>
<b>
Interpreted. 
</b>
The <b>@x:Act</b> interpreter is written in Java. <b>@x:Act</b> scripts can reference Java classes andcall Java methods and Java programs can invoke <b>@x:Act</b> scripts. <b>@x:Act</b> inherits much of the Java run-time supportincluding garbage collection, multithreading,and exception handling.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Dual Syntax. 
</b>
 <b>@x:Act</b> supports two complementary cleanlyintegrated syntaxes: one of which is pure XML(which includes XHTML) and the otheris more like that of Java.Both forms support full Unicode characters sets.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Static name scopes. 
</b>
Names are defined statically (prior to the start ofexecution) within a set of nested scopes.Each name use binds to the definition of the same namein the smallest enclosing scope.A "separate compilation" mechanism can be used to assemblean application from multiple scripts.Visibility controls support abstractionand data hiding.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Dynamically typed. 
</b>
In general, the type of the result of an expressioncan only be known after the expression has been executed.A variable can hold a value of any type.For prefix and infix operations the operator is typednot the operands.The types of expression results and variablescan be restricted by explicit type assertions. <b>@x:Act</b> views are similar to types.Although a value will have exactly one type,it can be associated with multiple views.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Rich built-in types. 
</b>
 <b>@x:Act</b> has two major built-in data types:strings and <a href="content_300.html" class="gloss1" target="contents">xdom</a>'s (<b>@x:Act</b> Document Object Model).Strings represent a sequence of Unicode charactersand may not be modified.Strings are also used for boolean, integer, float, and datevalues.Xdom's can be used to represent XML data, <b>@x:Act</b> scripts,arrays, records, lists, trees, and directed graphs.Every xdom (even those with cycles) has an ASCII external form.Parsers and unparsers (pretty printers) are providedto convert between internal xdom and external ASCIIstring forms.Xdom data structures can also be used fromJava programs.
</li>
<li>
<b>
User-defined abstractions. 
</b>
A full set of user definable abstractions are providedincluding modules, functions, types, views, iterators,and virtual variables (via lhs/rhs function pairs).Variable length parameter lists and keyword (named)parameters are available.All language operations are user definable.Abstractions support parameterized typesand generic/polymorphic functions. <b>@x:Act</b> does not provide class inheritance.Views provide a safer cleaner alternative.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Stack-based execution. 
</b>
Unlike languages such as Lisp, <b>@x:Act</b> stack frames are not retained when they are exited. <b>@x:Act</b> does however have an extended namefeature that can be used for currying andother techniques usually provided by retention.For multiple threads a "cactus stack" model is used.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Support for large data sets. 
</b>
 <b>@x:Act</b> provides incremental parsing and implicitstreams that allow large data structuresto be processed without all being in main memoryat the same time.
</li>
<li>
<b>
Multithreading. 
</b>
 <b>@x:Act</b> provides multithreading, locks/monitors (like those of Java),and queues (that can be used for CSP style programming).
</li>
<li>
<b>
Extensible. 
</b>
Extensible. <b>@x:Act</b> can be easily extended by defining new languages(collections of tags, operators, and abstractions).New functionality can be provided by escaping into Java(or even C via JNI).Multiple languages can be combined in single script tocombine functionality or to provide aspecification of multiple execution times/places (preprocess, server,client).
</li>
<li>
<b>
Interactive debugger (under development). 
</b>
The <b>@x:Act</b> interpreter includes an interactive debugger that supports breakpoints, stepping through code, andexamining values. Although useful, it is still quite rough; so use it at your own risk.
</li>
