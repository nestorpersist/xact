<p>
 <b>@x:Act</b> binds names statically.
</p>
<p>
Every occurrence of a name within a <font face="courier"><font face="courier">&lt;<a href="content_100.html" class="nt1" target="contents">script</a>&gt;</font></font> will eitherbe definition of that name of a use of that name.Every name used must be defined. Every name use is bound to its correspondingdefinition.
</p>
<p>
Every <font face="courier"><font face="courier">&lt;<a href="content_100.html" class="nt1" target="contents">script</a>&gt;</font></font> consists of a set of hierarchically nested scopes.Every name use and definition occurs within a single specific scope.The same name may not be defined twice within a single scope.Every name use is bound to the definition of that name in thesmallest enclosing scope.Thus a definition of a name in a scope "hides" any definitions of thatname in enclosing scopes.
</p>
<p>
Usually the definition of a name will occur before all usesof that name, but this is not required. Forward references wherea name use occurs before its definition are permitted.This makes it easy to write mutually recursive definitions.
