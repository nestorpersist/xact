      <p>
      &xact; (pronounced "exact")
      is a powerful scripting language with strong support for <ref:gloss name="XML"/> and <ref:gloss name="Java"/>.

      &xact; examples are a great way to learn &xact; and better understand how to use it more advanced features.
      Running examples (particularly by single stepping them via the debugger) can be helpful.
      &xact; example code can be found in the following places.
      <list:unordered>
      <list:item name="Introduction Examples">
      These simple example are included in the Introduction.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Reference Examples">
      A collection of more advanced examples are included in the Reference section.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Libraries">
      Source code of the libraries provides yet another set of examples.

   <section:numbered name="Uses">
   &xact; can be used in several ways.
   <list:unordered>
      <list:item name="Stand-alone">
	 &xact; is an excellent choice for writing stand-alone
	 applications.  It is particularly handy for writing string and XML utilities.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Web server">
	 &xact; can be used to quickly build advanced web sites.
	 &xact; scripts can be run using either <ref:gloss name="CGI"/> or Java <ref:gloss name="servlet"/>
	 connectors. Strong support is provided for <ref:gloss name="XHTML"/> and <ref:gloss name="HTTP"/>.
	 &xact; scripts are a great replacement for <ref:gloss name="JSP"/> being
	 both more powerful and easier to use.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Custom Languages">
	 &xact; can be used to quickly design and implement special-purpose
	 languages. Multiple custom languages can be easily combined
	 within a single application.
      </list:item>

   <section:numbered name="Major Features">
   The major features of &xact; are listed here.
   <list:unordered>
      <list:item name="Interpreted">
	 The &xact; interpreter is written in Java.
	 &xact; scripts can reference Java classes and
	 call Java methods and Java programs can invoke
	 &xact; scripts.
	 &xact; inherits much of the Java run-time support
	 including garbage collection, multithreading,
	 and exception handling.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Dual Syntax">
	 &xact; supports two complementary cleanly
	 integrated syntaxes: one of which is pure XML
	 (which includes XHTML) and the other
	 is more like that of Java.
	 Both forms support full Unicode characters sets.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Static name scopes">
	 Names are defined statically (prior to the start of
	 execution) within a set of nested scopes.
	 Each name use binds to the definition of the same name
	 in the smallest enclosing scope.
	 A "separate compilation" mechanism can be used to assemble
	 an application from multiple scripts.
	 Visibility controls support abstraction
	 and data hiding.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Dynamically typed">
	 In general, the type of the result of an expression
	 can only be known after the expression has been executed.
	 A variable can hold a value of any type.
	 For prefix and infix operations the operator is typed
	 not the operands.
	 The types of expression results and variables
	 can be restricted by explicit type assertions.
	 &xact; views are similar to types.
	 Although a value will have exactly one type,
	 it can be associated with multiple views.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Rich built-in types">
	 &xact; has two major built-in data types:
	 strings and <ref:gloss name="xdom"/>'s (&xact; Document Object Model).
	 Strings represent a sequence of Unicode characters
	 and may not be modified.
	 Strings are also used for boolean, integer, float, and date
	 values.
	 Xdom's can be used to represent XML data, &xact; scripts,
	 arrays, records, lists, trees, and directed graphs.
	 Every xdom (even those with cycles) has an ASCII external form.
	 Parsers and unparsers (pretty printers) are provided
	 to convert between internal xdom and external ASCII
	 string forms.
	 Xdom data structures can also be used from
	 Java programs.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="User-defined abstractions">
	 A full set of user definable abstractions are provided
	 including modules, functions, types, views, iterators,
	 and virtual variables (via lhs/rhs function pairs).
	 Variable length parameter lists and keyword (named)
	 parameters are available.
	 All language operations are user definable.
	 Abstractions support parameterized types
	 and generic/polymorphic functions.
	 &xact; does not provide class inheritance.
	 Views provide a safer cleaner alternative.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Stack-based execution">
	 Unlike languages such as Lisp,
	 &xact; stack frames are not retained when they are exited.
	 &xact; does however have an extended name
	 feature that can be used for currying and
	 other techniques usually provided by retention.
	 For multiple threads a "cactus stack" model is used.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Support for large data sets">
	 &xact; provides incremental parsing and implicit
	 streams that allow large data structures
	 to be processed without all being in main memory
	 at the same time.
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Multithreading">
	 &xact; provides multithreading, locks/monitors (like those of Java),
	 and queues (that can be used for CSP style programming).
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Extensible">
	 <b>Extensible.</b>
	 &xact; can be easily extended by defining new languages
	 (collections of tags, operators, and abstractions).
	 New functionality can be provided by escaping into Java
	 (or even C via JNI).
	 Multiple languages can be combined in single script to
	 combine functionality or to provide a
	 specification of multiple execution times/places (preprocess, server,
	 client).
      </list:item>
      <list:item name="Interactive debugger (under development)">
          The &xact; interpreter includes an interactive debugger that supports breakpoints, stepping through code, and
          examining values. Although useful, it is still quite rough; so use it at your own risk.
